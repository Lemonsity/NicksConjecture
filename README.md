# Nick's Conjecture
The conjecture is thought up by Nick Cheng from Univerity of Toronto Scarborough Campus (UTSC). This repository contains program that are designed to confirm if numbers below a certain threshold satisfies the conjecture before any further investigation.
More details will be added in the future

## Instruction
Run by doing following:
```
py V2.py <args>
```

## Arguments
- `-v, --variant`: 1 for including 2 as prime, 2 for excluding 2
- `-s, --start`: Starting number
- `-e, --end`: Ending number

## Codes
- `V2.py`: Code for checking Nick's Conjecture
- `PrimeGeneration.py`: Original prime generating algorithm
- `PrimeGeneration.java`: Prime generating algorithm allows for up to multi-billion
## Special Thanks:
- [The first fifty million primes](https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/): Proving the `primeX.txt` files used in this program
- [Prime I.T.](http://compoasso.free.fr/primelistweb/page/prime/accueil_en.php): Sieve algorithm that allows for generating primes up to multi-billions
